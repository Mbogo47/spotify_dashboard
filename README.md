# Spotify Listening History Dashboard
A dashboard analysing my spotify listening history

## Overview
This project is a data visualization dashboard that analyzes my Spotify listening history. It provides insights into my music preferences, top artists, genres, and listening trends. The dashboard was created using Python, Pandas, and Tableau for visualization.

## Process
### 1. Extracting Data
- Downloaded my Spotify listening history from Spotify's data request feature.
- Extracted and loaded the JSON/CSV file into a pandas DataFrame for preprocessing.

### 2. Cleaning and Preprocessing Data
- Parsed relevant fields such as track names, artists, timestamps, and duration played.
- Converted timestamps into a datetime format.
- Removed duplicate or incomplete entries.
- Extracted additional metadata like genre and album name (if available).

### 3. Data Analysis
- Identified top artists, genres, and most-played tracks.
- Analyzed listening habits by time of day, day of the week, and month.
- Calculated total listening time and average session duration.
- Compared listening trends over different time periods.

### 4. Data Visualization
- Used Tableau to create interactive dashboards.
- Designed bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps to visualize trends.
- Created a summary dashboard showcasing key insights like top songs, top artists, and total listening time.

### 5. Deployment & Sharing
- Exported dashboards as interactive reports.
- Shared insights through screenshots and summary reports.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data preprocessing and analysis (pandas, json, datetime)
- **Tableau**: Data visualization and dashboard creation
- **Spotify Data Export**: Data extraction


## Future Improvements
- Integrate Spotify API for real-time data updates.
- Build a web-based dashboard using Streamlit or Flask.
- Add sentiment analysis for song lyrics or user playlists.

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into my music consumption habits and helped me understand my preferences better. The visual dashboard makes it easy to analyze trends and optimize my listening experience.
